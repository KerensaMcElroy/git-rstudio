## Why do we need version control?

## What is version control?

There are lots of different tools that implement version control (generally referred to as **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystems, **VCS**). They all have common features, including:

- A system which **records snapshots** of a project
- Implementation of **branching**:
  - you can work on several feature branches and switch between them
  - different people can work on the same code/project in parallel without interfering
  - you can experiment with an idea and discard it if it turns out to be a bad idea
- Implementation of **merging**:
  - tool to merge different versions of a file

## Code becomes a disaster without version control


### Roll-back functionality

- Mistakes happen - without recorded snapshots you cannot easily undo mistakes and go back to a working version.


### Branching

- Often you want to experiment with an idea, or work on different approaches in one file - without branching this can be messy and confusing.
- You can simulate branching by copying the entire code to multiple places but also this will be messy and confusing.

### Reproducibility

- How do you indicate which version of your code you have used in your paper?
- When you find a bug, how do you know when precisely this bug was introduced
  (are published results affected? do you need to inform collaborators or users of your code?).


### What is the problem with this kind of "version control"?

Discuss the following directory listing:

```shell

## We will use [Git](https://git-scm.com) to record snapshots of our work - why Git?

- Easy to set up - use even by yourself with no server needed.
- Very popular: chances are high you will need to contribute to somebody else's code which is tracked with Git.
- Distributed: good backup, no single point of failure, you can track and clean-up changes offline, simplifies collaboration model for open-source projects.
- Important platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
  build on top of Git.
- Sharing software and data is getting popular and required in research context
  and [GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular platform for sharing software.
- However, *"Git is a four-handle, dual boiler espresso machine, not instant coffee."* [citation needed].
  Git isn't the most user friendly and has its design quirks but deep design
  is great and is definitely the most popular and what you are most likely to
  need to know. So we teach it.
