To practice the interactions learned today, we will collect our notes on Git into a single repository.
While this is an example of how to collaborate using Git/GitHub, we won't be taking advantage of *all* 
the collaborative features of Git because we will **not** be editing each other's files. 

Most of the  errors you are likely to encounter with Git will arise when trying to deal with 
conflicting changes made by two people to the same file. Learning how to merge conflicting commits
in this situation is more than we can cover in one day and so we will avoid the situation.

> ## Challenge 1
> Create a new project that clones the [Course notes](https://github.com/csiro-data-school/focus-course-notes) repo
> 
> Under the `git` folder, you will see folders for a range of topics/commands.
>
> Record your notes from the session in the relevant folders. Save the files as `<YOUR_NAME>-notes.txt`
> to avoid conflicts with other participant's notes.
>
> Remember to commit and push at appropriate points.
>
> Pull changes from the remote repo to see your classmates notes.
